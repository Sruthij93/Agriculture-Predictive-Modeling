# Crop Recommendation System

This project was developed as part of a DataCamp exercise. The goal of the project is to assist farmers in making informed decisions about which crops to grow based on the features of the soil available to them. By leveraging machine learning and predictive modeling, the system can analyze soil characteristics and recommend the most suitable crops.
##It uses a multi-class classification model to predict the type of crop and also checks which feature is the most important in predicting what crop should be grown.
