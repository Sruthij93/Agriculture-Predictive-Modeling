# Crop Recommendation System

This project was developed as part of a DataCamp exercise. The goal of the project is to assist farmers in making informed decisions about which crops to grow based on the features of the soil available to them. By leveraging machine learning and predictive modeling, the system can analyze soil characteristics and recommend the most suitable crops.
